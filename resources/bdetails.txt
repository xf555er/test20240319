process to run a mimikatz command.

Use ! to make mimikatz elevate to SYSTEM before it runs your command. Some

Use @ to make mimikatz impersonate Beacon's thread token before it runs your
command. This is helpful for mimikatz commands that interact with remote
systems (e.g., lsadump::dcsync)

beacon> help pth
Use: pth [pid] [arch] [DOMAIN\user] [NTLM hash]
     pth [DOMAIN\user] [NTLM hash]

Inject a screenshot tool into the specified process.

Use printscreen with no arguments to spawn a temporary process and inject the 
screenshot tool into it.

Printscreen forces a PrintScr keypress and grabs the screenshot from the
clipboard. It then exits. This command will clear the clipboard contents after
its done.

No long-running variant of this exists because... let's face it... nuking the
clipboard periodically is probably not good OPSEC.

beacon> help screenwatch
Use: screenwatch [pid] <x86|x64>
     screenwatch 

Inject a screen watcher tool into the specified process.

Use screenwatch with no arguments to spawn a temporary process and inject the 
screen watch tool into it.

Screenwatch sends a screenshot of the user's desktop (one per Beacon check-in)
until terminated. If the user is idle, the screen watch tool will take a new
screenshot every three minutes.

To terminate this task: use jobs to find the job ID. Use jobkill to kill it.

Use: rportfwd_local [bind port] [forward host] [forward port]
     rportfwd_local stop [bind port]

Binds the specified port on the target host. When a connection comes in,

Cobalt Strike client, and use Beacon to relay traffic between the two connections.

beacon> help elevate
Use: elevate [exploit] [listener]

Type elevate by itself to see a list of available local exploits.

beacon> help jump

Beacon will try to authenticate as a local user.

This command will usually fail if you're in a SYSTEM context. Use make_token
to create a token to pass the desired credentials instead.

beacon> help portscan
Use: portscan [pid] [arch] [targets] [ports] [arp|icmp|none] [max connections]
     portscan [targets] [ports] [arp|icmp|none] [max connections]

Inject into the specified process to run a port scan against the specified hosts.

Use portscan with no [pid] and [arch] arguments to spawn a temporary
process to run a port scan against the specified hosts.

[targets] is a comma separated list of hosts to scan. You may also specify
IPv4 address ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.128-192.168.2.240, 192.168.1.0/24)

[ports] is a comma separated list or ports to scan. You may specify port
ranges as well (e.g., 1-65535)

The [arp|icmp|none] options dictate how the port scanning tool will determine
if a host is alive. The ARP option uses ARP to see if a system responds to the
specified address. The ICMP option sends an ICMP echo request. The none option 
tells the portscan tool to assume all hosts are alive.

The [max connections] option limits how many connections the port scan tool
will attempt at any one time. The portscan tool uses asynchronous I/O and
it's able to handle a large number of connections at one time. A higher value
will make the portscan go much faster. The default is 1024.
